# Discord data summarizer [GUI]
Rewrite of a script DecimalCubed wrote, it reads a discord data packets messages and gives you really basic information, but made slightly easier thru GUI.

Gives you information on how many messages you posted, and your most chatted in channels, for the years 2020-2025 (its hardcoded, we're too lazy to do it better)
Doesnt give ANY information on how much time youve spent in vcs. I'd have to agree w/ DecimalCubed that it'd be a pain to parse all that data.

Program's probably still jank but it seems to work. Need to test it but don't have data to test with.

## This works on anything able to run Python and TKinter
If you are on linux/mac you will no longer have to figure something out on your own 
-# You're welcome

# To use:
First, obtain a data package, if you already have one, skip this
1. Go to 'Data & Privacy' in settings.
2. Scroll down to 'Request your data'
3. Request a package with the 'Messages' option enabled
4. Wait to recieve the package in the email
5. Download and unzip it


# Download the data summarizer py file
If you wanna compile it yourself, feel free. I'm not doing all that for a goof.

# Open your data
1. Run discord_summary.py
2. Open the directory thru the file picker (check extra info if you like idc)
3. Wait a bit. Python is pretty slow at this stuff.
   
We'll see if this all works. Report issues as needed.
